<b>Safely to space on a budget</b>

With our launch assistance service, there's no need to invest
in costly spacecraft.

We offer a safe ride on our launch assistance rockets,
and even give free boosts to solar sail based spacecraft
with our top of the line satellite laser system.

All you need is a digital ticket from our website and
we will handle the rest when you arrive at the launch area of
any of the Venusian stations.
